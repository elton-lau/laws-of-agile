    "summaryP1": "This resource collects the underlying \"laws\" that govern software delivery, team interactions, and organizational dynamics. While not strict physical laws, these observations—captured by organization psychology, computer science, and systems dynamics—provide a powerful lens to understand why agile transformations succeed or fail.",
    "summaryP2": "By understanding the forces at play within complex systems, we can make better decisions, design more resilient organizations, and foster environments where innovation flows naturally.",
