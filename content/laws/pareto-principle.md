  - title: Prioritization
    content: Focus on the 20% of features that deliver 80% of the value.
  - title: Bug Fixing
    content: Fixing the top 20% of reported bugs often resolves 80% of user errors and crashes.
  - title: The 80/20 Fallacy
    content: Don't assume the final 20% of work will take 20% of the time. It often consumes 80% of the effort (the "ninety-ninety rule").

Also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity. It states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

In software engineering, this principle is omnipresent: 80% of users use only 20% of features; 80% of errors are caused by 20% of bugs. Identifying and focusing on these "vital few" allows teams to maximize impact with limited resources.

### Pareto's Fallacy (The 90/90 Rule)

A common pitfall is the **Pareto Fallacy**: believing that once 80% of the work is done, you are 80% finished. In reality, the remaining 20% of the work (polish, edge cases, deployment, security) often consumes 80% of the total time.

This recursive nature of the principle is famously captured by the **Ninety-Ninety Rule**:
> "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."
> — *Tom Cargill, Bell Labs*
