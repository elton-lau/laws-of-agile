  context: '"The Mythical Man-Month" (1975).'
  quote: The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.
takeaways:
  - title: Ramp-up Time
    content: New team members need time to learn the project structure, goals, and codebase, consuming time from existing members who must mentor them.
  - title: Communication Overhead
    content: "As the number of people on a team increases, the number of communication channels increases combinatorially (n(n-1)/2), leading to more meetings and coordination effort."
  - title: Task Divisibility
    content: Not all tasks can be parallelized. Just because a woman can produce a baby in nine months doesn't mean nine women can produce a baby in one month.

Brooks's Law is a claim about software project management that states that adding more resources to a project that is running behind schedule will actually delay it further. This counter-intuitive principle highlights the complexities of communication and onboarding in collaborative knowledge work.
