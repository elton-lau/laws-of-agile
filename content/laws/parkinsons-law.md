Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. This adage highlights the inefficiency of bureaucracy and the tendency for tasks to become more complex and time-consuming than necessary when no strict time limits are imposed.

In Agile, we use **Timeboxing** (Sprints) to counter this. By fixing the time available, we force scope to be variable and encourage the team to focus on the highest value items first, rather than polishing low-value features forever.
