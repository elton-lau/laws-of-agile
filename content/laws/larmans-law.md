Larman's Laws of Organizational Behavior describe the friction encountered when attempting to change complex organizations. The most critical insight is that "Culture follows structure"—meaning that organizational design (roles, responsibilities, hierarchy) dictates the culture, not the other way around.

This principle is famously illustrated by the **NUMMI** (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) joint venture between Toyota and GM. As **John Shook**, who helped manage the transformation, observed: 

"It’s easier to act your way to a new way of thinking than to think your way to a new way of acting."

At NUMMI, the culture didn't change because management gave speeches about quality or teamwork. It changed because the **production system (the structure)** was changed to the Toyota Production System. By changing the way people worked—giving them the power to stop the line (Andon cord) and requiring teamwork—the culture of quality and support emerged naturally from the new behaviors.
