Hackman's Law suggests that the effectiveness of a team is inversely proportional to its size. As a group grows, the overhead of communication and coordination grows exponentially, while the vulnerability to "social loafing" increases. J. Richard Hackman, a pioneer in organizational behavior, famously stated that big teams usually end up wasting time on politics and waiting for others.
