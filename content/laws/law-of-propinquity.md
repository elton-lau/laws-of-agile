summary: The likelihood of communication between two people decreases as the physical distance between them increases.
category: second-way
origin:
  author: Thomas J. Allen
  context: '"Managing the Flow of Technology" (1977).'
  quote: We are more likely to communicate with people who are physically close to us.
takeaways:
  - title: The Allen Curve
    content: Communication frequency drops exponentially with distance. 50 meters of separation is often equivalent to being in different buildings.
  - title: Remote Equivalence
    content: In distributed teams, "distance" is measured in time zones and friction to connect. Reduce friction to increase "virtual propinquity".

The Law of Propinquity, often visualized as the Allen Curve, states that there is a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between engineers. It suggests that high-bandwidth communication—critical for complex problem solving—relies heavily on physical proximity or very low-friction virtual alternatives.
