The Theory of Constraints is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e. constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

A famous illustration from Goldratt's book **"The Goal"** is the boy scout hike, where the troop can only move as fast as the slowest walker, **"Herbie"**. To speed up the troop, they don't yell at the fast walkers to go faster; they lighten Herbie's backpack and put him at the front of the line. In software, "Herbie" is often testing, deployment, or code review—optimizing anything else is a waste.
