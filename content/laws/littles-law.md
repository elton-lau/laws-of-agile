    content: To reduce lead time (W), you must reduce Work In Progress (L) or increase throughput (λ).
  - title: Predictability
    content: Stable systems are more predictable. Variability in arrival or processing times disrupts the flow.

Little's Law is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate multiplied by the average time that a customer spends in the system.
