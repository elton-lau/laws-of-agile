### 21 Laws · 3 Ways of DevOps · Multiple Languages

*From Conway's Law to the Theory of Constraints—understand the timeless principles that shape how teams build software.*

</div>

## ✨ What is Laws of Agile?

This resource collects the underlying "laws" that govern software delivery, team interactions, and organizational dynamics. While not strict physical laws, these observations—captured by organization psychology, software engineering, and systems dynamics—provide a powerful lens to understand why agile transformations succeed or fail.

By understanding the forces at play within complex systems, we can make better decisions, design more resilient organizations, and foster environments where innovation flows naturally.

**Laws of Agile** is a curated collection of these foundational principles, organized by **The Three Ways of DevOps**:

| Way | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| 🌊 **Flow** | Optimizing the speed of value delivery from idea to customer |
| 🔄 **Feedback** | Creating fast loops of information to catch problems early |
| 🧠 **Learning** | Fostering a culture of experimentation and continuous mastery |

## 🚀 Why This Matters

By understanding the forces at play within complex systems, you can:

- 🎯 **Make better decisions** about team structure and software architecture
- 🏗️ **Design resilient organizations** that adapt to change
- 💡 **Foster environments** where innovation flows naturally
- ⚡ **Accelerate delivery** by working with these forces, not against them

Whether you're a **tech lead**, **engineering manager**, **Scrum Master**, or **individual contributor**, these principles will sharpen your thinking about how software really gets built.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is inspired by the wonderful [**Laws of UX**](https://lawsofux.com) by Jon Yablonski—a beautifully curated collection of design principles that every designer should know. 

We wanted to create something similar for the **DevOps and Agile community**: a resource that distills timeless wisdom into an accessible, shareable format.
